New work in this project is licensed under the GNU GPL, Version 3.  That includes
most of the executable files in the tool chain, and the run-time library.  See the
file 'license\copying_with_exception' for details.

A special exception is that use of the run-time library, in either source format or by
linking to a compiled version of it, does not automatically require a program that uses
it to itself become gnu licensed.   However, this does not void other reasons why the
run-time library is gnu-licensed, for example modifying the library then linking the
modified version into a program will require that gnu licensing be followed for the
library itself; for example the library source code has to be made available.

An exception is that the WIN32 header files were derived from GNU sources, and
are covered under the GNU lesser public license.  Since these files are header
files rather than code it is unclear whether using them causes the GNU licensing
terms to attach to derivative works.  See the file 'license\copying' for details.

Additionally, the OCL program was originally written by Kirill Joss.
