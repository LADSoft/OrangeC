    support extends for classes

Version 2.10:
	bug fix:  escape '"' and '\' in ldstr operand
	bug fix:  fix a crash
	bug fix:  handle enum references properly and load enum values

Version 2.9:
	bug fix:  allow System.Diagnostics.Process to load

Version 2.8:
	bug fix:  if a global field is of type class and the class is from an external assembly ref,
			  the IL file wass correct but the PE file had a bad signature for the field's type
	bug fix:  last property in a long list of properties could be loaded incorrectly
	netlink:  don't thunk C-style entry point if the incoming program has an entry point
	bug fix:  custom attributes not registered correctly

Version 2.7:
	various improvements to property creation
	bug fix: fix the problem with quoted types in external assemblies in a better way

Version 2.6:
	bug fix: search for assembly on path failed

Version 2.5:
	bug fix: escape control characters when writing strings to the .il file...
	bug fix: don't quote types from external assemblies
	bug fix: fix crash when System.Windows.dll is loaded

Version 2.4:
	bug fix: in some assemblies parent classes sometimes are listed AFTER the child classes, which resulted in a crash
	bug fix: name and box native integers properly

Version 2.3:
	bug fix: using namespace.cls in an object file failed for empty method signatures
	bug fix: integers were being maxed at 2gigs because of use of atoi

Version 2.2:
    add routines to read and write object files
    add a linker to link object files
    bug fix: add the valuetype flag to the qualifiers on enumerations
    bug fix: ldarg instruction was considered to have five bytes, not 4.   This could mess up branch generation if
             there are hundreds of arguments
    bug fix: the object[] variable used for setup for calling VARARG functions was declared as void * in the locals,
		.NET was ok with it but MONO was too restrictive to accept it.

    bug fix: fix the 'dump' utility to work with the latest code base

Version 2.1:
    speed up GAC searches
    allow searching for a specific version of a DLL in the GAC.
    add support for 'explicit' classes
    fix bug: allow boxing of 'string' type

Version 2.0:
    read public members of assemblies into the internal database - searches the GAC or takes the path of an assembly
    add support for simple properties
    add support for arrays and remove 'objectarray' type
    add support for 'ref' argument types
    fully support assembly versions
    cache the custom attribute database for purposes of being able to parse files; 
        in general you cannot declare custom attributes though
    add lookup functions to find assembly members of referenced assemblies
    clean up some duplicate definitions in the API.
    update demo code to use new APIs.
    add new demos
    fix bug: integer constants were being represented in hexadecimal in the .il file
    fix bug: in the IL src types were quoted in boxing and newarr

Version 1.2:
    remove sdata section; move the data into the CIL data section (fix for avast
        not liking generated files)
    add strong name key hashing
    fix bug putting large data in the blob

Version 1.1:
    fix problems with generating the binary for large programs

Version 1.0:
    initial release
