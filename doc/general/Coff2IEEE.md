# Coff2IEEE

**Coff2IEEE** is a program that takes COFF-formatted import libraries of the type generated by Microsoft tools, and converts them to Orange C format.   While it is somewhat capable of converting other types of libraries, the primary focus is for import libraries.

At this time Coff2IEEE only understands C and STDCALL naming conventions (C++ names will be invisible to the tools)

## Coff2IEEE Command line options

The general form of a Coff2IEEE command line is:

>    Coff2IEEE [options] inputfile

here the _inputfile_ is the name of COFF-formatted import library

### Setting output file

By default **Coff2IEEE** will take the name of the input file, and replace the extension with '.l'.   However the **/o** switch can be used to set an output file name.


>    Coff2IEEE -omyfile.l cofffile.lib


### Alternative display options

 The **/V** switch shows version information, and the compile date

 The **/!** or **--nologo** switch is 'nologo'
