New work in this project is licensed under the GNU GPL, Version 3.  That includes
most of the executable files in the tool chain, and the run-time library.  See the
file 'license\copying_with_exception' for details.

A special exception is that use of the run-time library, in either source format or by
linking to a compiled version of it, does not automatically require a program that uses
it to itself become gnu licensed.   However, this does not void other reasons why the
run-time library is gnu-licensed, for example modifying the library then linking the
modified version into a program will require that gnu licensing be followed for the
library itself; for example the library source code has to be made available.

An exception is that the WIN32 header files were derived from the Pelles C compiler 
runtime library.   Pelles C was also derived from LCC.   The licensing from both parties
says that no commerical use can be made of things derived from Pelles C; in addition
the licensing of LCC says that LCC must be attributed in the documentation.

Additionally, the OCL program was originally written by Kirill Joss.
