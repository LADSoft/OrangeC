  Qsmodel is a quasistatic probability model that periodically
  (at chooseable intervals) updates probabilities of symbols;
  it also allows to initialize probabilities. Updating is done more
  frequent in the beginning, so it adapts very fast even without
  initialisation.

  it provides function for creation, deletion, query for probabilities
  and symbols and model updating.

  for usage see example.c
