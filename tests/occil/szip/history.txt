June  2, 1997 MS  release of version 1.00
June  9, 1997 MS  release 1.01 minor bugfix in compression; sometimes
                  got last byte wrong.  Format unchanged
July 22, 1997 MS  1.02: decompression has no more hash-table overflows
                  and is faster. I also rearranged modules.
                  Other compiler. Format unchanged
July 29, 1997 MS  1.03 UUPS - a little pice of byte order dependent
                  code made it into 1.02 decode, which caused lots of
                  failures. Didn't do testing on PC.
                  Also added an alpha test (sunzip_f) for new fast
                  decode method. Format unchanged.
Aug  10, 1997 MS  1.04 Bugfix in fast decompression; distributing fast
                  decompression; first linux distribution
Sept 23, 1997 MS  1.05X inofficial release, will not be further supported
                  demonstrates command line options
Sept 28, 1997 MS  1.05Xa bugfix in recordsize.
Oct  31, 1997 MS  1.05Xd some parameters added, revived old code for
                  order 4
Nov  18, 1997 MS  1.05Xe bugfix when compressing large random files,
                  different compiler options.
Feb-Jun  1998 MS  1.10 introduces a new, incompatible fileformat:
                  Header (SZ\012\004). Restart after each block for
                  error tolerance. Changed entropy coder. Support
                  for unlimited order (-o0). Complete rewrite of the
                  probability estimation.
                  The compressed format produced by this version can
                  be processed faster than the old one; even through
                  this program version does a lot of unnecessary and
                  inefficient things it is as fast as the old one.
Aug      1998 MS  New format again to fix a bug in szip 1.10 and to
                  use a new model (cache) for encoding the model used.
Sep      1999 MS  1.12 for some operating systems - uses macros instead of
                  functions for IO
Mar      2000 MS  keeps memory allocated across blocks to avoid some
                  memory managements that will not allow a working set
                  greater than the memory currently used. (1.12a)
Oct      2000 MS  removed some compiler warning and signed/unsigned
                  implicit pointer casting. (1.12)
