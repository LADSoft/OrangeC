			to reduce the number of floating point registers in use simultaneously
version 4.1.12
	rtl:	fix WIN32 header bug that caused CCIDE to not work reliably

version 4.1.11
	OCC - remove import record from ASM file, when DLL name not specified
	OCC - fix problems with statements such as:

			was a pointer, would crash the compiler
			
version 4.1.9
	OCC	- there was a problem with sign extensions in statements such as p+=c

	OCC - 4.1.7 broke some programs with infinite loops
	OCC - fix problem where strength reduction could be incorrectly applied
			when induction variables of nested loops were multiplied together
	OCC - fix problem with division: sequences such as:

			t = t / 60

			would incorrectly generate code for:

			a = t % 60
			t = t / 60 / 60
			b = t % 60
			t = t / 60 / 60

			because of bugs in dealing with the x86 IDIV instruction

	OASM -  some floating point instructions involving memory access were generated incorrectly
	OCC	-	floating point - use memory access more often
	OCC -   floating point - change div by a constant into mul by a constant
	OCC -   loops - generate code at the top of the loop to test the loop condition
			instead of branching to the bottom of the loop
			(while and for loops) and optimize such code away when possible.
	OCC -   worked on constant propagation code, was not folding assignments
	OCL	-	use OASM instead of ONASM
	OMAKE - fix problem where VPATH would not be considered if a file did not exist
	OMAKE - fix 'F' and 'D' suffixes on special macros, for example $@F and $@D

			on large bulky functions.
	OCC - fix problem with register allocator, on very complex programs register

			in a command the VPATH path was missing
	OMAKE - enable searching for implicit rules when explicit rules exist for dependencies
			but there are no commands
	ORC - add LOADONCALL parsing (doesn't do anything)
	ORC - scan for bitmap files etc... on the include path
	RTL - utime.h is now in *both* include and include\sys for portability
	RTL - add VOS__ constants to windows.h
	RTL - toolchain and generated programs would crash if an environment variable was greater than 1024 bytes long
	RTL - fix console mode of stdin to allow echoed line input on windows 7
	RTL - fix getch() and friends - were broken because of the compiler union packing issue
	RTL - rename winversion.h to winver.h

Version 4.1.2
	OASM - was generating an error when a large number was used as
		a byte operand to a math instruction but it was in-range for a signed value.
	OCC - feature addition - OCC will look in its home directory for olink.exe
	OCC - prototype warnings - only warn once, remove superfluous warnings
	OCC - /O switch would add a .o extension to an executable and use it as an object file
		which resulted in duplicate modules being passed to the linker and linker errors.
		fix the /O switch to only register the exe name.
	OCC - if a continuation character '\' was used in strings, and it was followed
		by a // style comment within the string, this generated parser errors.
	OCC - was filling out the entire BSS with zeros, which resulted in very 
		large object files when there is a lot of static uninitialized data
	OCC - when compile fails, delete the output file
    OCC - correct code gen/register allocation/peephole optimization bugs
	OLINK - documentation changed to use correct target names for windows targets
	RTL - when the following was done in the source prior to including files:

		#define size_t int

		then there was a collision between string.h and memory.h
