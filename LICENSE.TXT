New work in this project is licensed under the GNU GPL, Version 3.  That includes
most of the executable files in the tool chain, and the run-time library.  See the
file 'license\copying_with_exception' for details.

A special exception is that use of the run-time library, in either source format or by
linking to a compiled version of it, does not automatically require a program that uses
it to itself become gnu licensed.   However, this does not void other reasons why the
run-time library is gnu-licensed, for example modifying the library then linking the
modified version into a program will require that gnu licensing be followed for the
library itself; for example the library source code has to be made available.

The windows header files are derived from Pelles C.   Pelles C is derived from LCC.
The licensing for Pelles C is that things derived from Pelles C cannot be used commerically.
LCC also doesn't want things to be used commerically, but it has an additional stipulation 
that there has to be acknowledgement of use.   These header files remain under the Pelles C
and LCC licenses and are not covered by the GNU license that the rest of the runtime library
abides by.

Additionally, this package redistributes the runtimes for several MSDOS extenders.
Licensing terms can be found in the 'license' directory.
