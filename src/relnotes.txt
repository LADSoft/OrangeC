Release notes:

version 5.52.1:
    occ:        expressions involving bit fields did not get evaluated properly
                unless the expression was an assignment or comparison
    occ:        fix bug with operator-> returning pointer to class: if this was used as
                a function argument bad code would be generated
    occ:        move constructors or assignment operators could sometimes be called when unintended
                when invoked in a return statement.
                (e.g. it would zero out strings during a construction or copy to another string)
    occ:        there were bugs comparing a member pointer variable against zero
    occ:        member pointer function variable could not be compare to a function
    occ:        for a reference type, it didn't call virtual functions properly
    occ:        sometimes an object would be considered by-ref when it wasn't really
                messed up function returns from constructors and other functions that return a pointer
                to structure
    occ:        during global destruction of objects, destructor call for an array could zero 
                out the object before destroying it
    occ:        constructor calls qualified with class/namespace selectors could be treated as declarations
    occ:        references to member pointers as function parameters resulted in invalid code
    occ:        taking the address of a reference to a pointer and passing it to a function resulted in bad code
    occ:        in initializing a structure from another structure, a this pointer could be inserted when it shouldn't be
    occ:        temporary classes created during an expression would not get a destructor call
    occ:        ! and some other unary operators generated code to perform the function even after
                calling an overloaded operator function. (so the function got applied twice)
    occ:        when objects that have to be constructed are default parameters, the
                space for the objects does not get allocated if they are used.
    libcxx:     fix problem with not enough space being allocated for locale in ios structure
    clibs:      fix malloc/free to detect doubly freed pointers with more alacrity
Version 5.51.1: 1/16/16
    occ:        fix a compiler crash when compiling boolinq.h

    occ:        lambda functions defined at global scope would crash the compiler
    occ:        initialized structures involving substructures could crash the compiler

    occ:        auto variables of class and template type were problematic when used inside lambda functions
    occ:        lambda functions without a trailing return would not get an inferred return type
    occ:        size of an unsized array was calculated as number of bytes not number of elements when used
                in a template parameter
    occ:        overloaded functions found in different namespaces would be ambiguous even
                without the same signatures
    occ:        if an overloaded symbol was found in the main namespace,
                'using' namespaces wouldn't be searched.
    occ:        new of pointer type didn't work (e.g new char *[10])
    occ:        specifying an exception specifier with an undefined type crashed the compiler
    occ:        uninitialized unsized arrays found in a structure definition could crash the compiler
    occ:        class objects at global scope could sometimes generate bad code for the constructor call
                (would not link)

    occ:        ::id()   didn't work when id was both a global function and a class member variable
    occ:        cast operators might not be resolved when duplicates are found due to a

    occ:        creating a cast function with an undefined type crashes the compiler
    occ:        initializing a member pointer with NULL could cause the compiler to crash.
    occ:        there were problems with instantiating a template that was previously declared 'external'
                (link errors)
    occ:        a template class that included template functions did not compile properly if the
                instantiation took place within an argument in a class member function
    occ:        'template' and 'friend' together sometimes resulted in unfindable functions
    occ:        fix some problems compiling manipulators

	OCC - deal with zero-length anonymous bit fields properly
	OCC	- more speedups
	OCC	- deal with several crash conditions
	OCC - deal with some incorrect code generation problems
	OCC - fix some floating point problems

version 4.15
	OASM -  fix problems with constants, structures, and improve code gen for move immediate to reg
	OCC	- 	speed up compilations, fix bugs, add a branch optimization
	OMAKE -	fix bugs
	ORC	-	allow integer values for resource types, e.g. for manifests

	distributing source starting with this version

version 4.1.4
	OASM -  some floating point instructions involving memory access were generated incorrectly
	OCC	-	floating point - use memory access more often
	OCC -   floating point - change div by a constant into mul by a constant
	OCC -   loops - generate code at the top of the loop to test the loop condition
			instead of branching to the bottom of the loop
			(while and for loops) and optimize such code away when possible.
	OCC -   worked on constant propagation code, was not folding assignments
	OCL	-	use OASM instead of ONASM
	OMAKE - fix problem where VPATH would not be considered if a file did not exist
	OMAKE - fix 'F' and 'D' suffixes on special macros, for example $@F and $@D

version 4.1.3
	OCC - fix two crash conditions in code generator
	OCC - some algorithmic rewrites to get an order of magnitude speed improvement
			on large bulky functions.
	OCC - fix problem with register allocator, on very complex programs register
			usage could sometimes overlap when it shouldn't
	OCC - fix problem in static initialization when fixed point constants are 
			stored as floating point constants:  size of the storage did not match
			size when the value was loaded
	OCC - fix peephole optimization problem that caused code to disappear
	OCC - fix floating point global optimization to adjust properly for x86 FP unit
	OCC - fix register allocation/peephole optimization in the presence of infinite loops
	OCC - add the functionality to use two-character character constants
	OCC - fix packing of unions to work according to the windows standard...
	OCC - fix problems with cascaded shift operations
	OCC - fix problems with aliasing in the presence of assignments of structures
	OMAKE - dependencies were correctly qualified off VPATH, but when they showed up
			in a command the VPATH path was missing
	OMAKE - enable searching for implicit rules when explicit rules exist for dependencies
			but there are no commands
	ORC - add LOADONCALL parsing (doesn't do anything)
	ORC - scan for bitmap files etc... on the include path
	RTL - utime.h is now in *both* include and include\sys for portability
	RTL - add VOS__ constants to windows.h
	RTL - toolchain and generated programs would crash if an environment variable was greater than 1024 bytes long
	RTL - fix console mode of stdin to allow echoed line input on windows 7
	RTL - fix getch() and friends - were broken because of the compiler union packing issue
	RTL - rename winversion.h to winver.h

Version 4.1.2
	OASM - was generating an error when a large number was used as
		a byte operand to a math instruction but it was in-range for a signed value.
	OCC - feature addition - OCC will look in its home directory for olink.exe
	OCC - prototype warnings - only warn once, remove superfluous warnings
	OCC - /O switch would add a .o extension to an executable and use it as an object file
		which resulted in duplicate modules being passed to the linker and linker errors.
		fix the /O switch to only register the exe name.
	OCC - if a continuation character '\' was used in strings, and it was followed
		by a // style comment within the string, this generated parser errors.
	OCC - was filling out the entire BSS with zeros, which resulted in very 
		large object files when there is a lot of static uninitialized data
	OCC - when compile fails, delete the output file
    OCC - correct code gen/register allocation/peephole optimization bugs
	OLINK - documentation changed to use correct target names for windows targets
	RTL - when the following was done in the source prior to including files:

		#define size_t int

		then there was a collision between string.h and memory.h
